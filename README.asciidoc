Baiṭha: The Scala/Android Toolkit
=================================
Daniel Solano_Gómez

Baitha is a library designed to make Scala development on Android easier and
more fun.  It leverages some of Scala's features such as mix-ins and implicit
conversions to make Android development with Scala a bit more idiomatic.

== Current features

Baitha is still under heavy development.  Some of its current features include:

AlertDialogBuilder::

  An wrapper around Android's `AlertDialog.Builder` class that provides some
  implicit conversions and a mini-DSL.

BuildMode::

  A trait that makes converting between debug/production code easier.

EnhancedViews::

  Provides some implicit conversions to make adding listeners as functions.

Logger::

  A replacement logging interface inspired by https://code.google.com/p/roboguice/[RoboGuice].

SdkVersions::

  Offers conditional execution depending on the runtime version of the Android
  platform.

TypedColumn and TypedCursorWrapper::

  An easier way to get data out of a cursor.


== Using the library

Baitha was originally designed to be used as an Android library project.
Unfortunately, due to breaking changes from the Android SDK, SBT, and the
SBT android-plugin, Scala-based library projects are not supported at this
time.

However, because Baitha does not contain any other libraries, resources, or
assets, it is possible to use it as a binary-only library using SBT's library
management mechanism.


=== Adding the library to your project

In order to use Baitha in your project, you will need to add a new resolver to
your project.  Baitha's snapshots may be found at
`http://sattvik.github.com/baitha/snapshots`.  To add this to your project, you
will need to add the resolver as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
resolvers += "Baitha snapshots" at "http://sattvik.github.com/baitha/snapshots"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, you will need to add the dependency, using something like:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0ibraryDependencies += "com.sattvik" %% "baitha" % "0.1.1-SNAPSHOT",
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Binary compatibility

Baitha is currently tested and cross-compiled with the following Scala versions:

* 2.10.5
